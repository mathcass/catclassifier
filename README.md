# Cat Classifier

I think deep learning is accessible enough now that if you know how to program,
you know how to get started using it for your own tasks. This great
[article](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-3-deep-learning-and-convolutional-neural-networks-f40359318721#.469g9yw20)
shows you how you can use `tflearn`, a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
based Python library to create predictive models based on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This is a simple implementation using the same neural network layout to identify
labeled photos of my cat.
